# Documentation Contribution

The documentation is build up on .md files and uses docsify to display and organize those files

### Getting Started
**1.** Install the docsify-cli globally: (Node.js required)
```
npm i docsify-cli -g
```
**2.** Clone the Pulse Repository (Use the `development`-branch for current changes, `main`-branch is equal to the current app-version)

**3.** Open the `/docs` folder and type the following command in your terminal/cli:
```
docsify serve
```
**4.** By default it will serve the docs to your localhost port 3000, open the following site in your browser to see the docs:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```
**5.** Now you can modify and improve the .md file in the `/docs` folder and see the live changes in your browser
