# Compatibility Table

Each Function or Api that has individual platform implementations has a "Compatibility Table".
The "Compatibility Table" displays a green dot if the function is supported or a red dot if it's not supported on that platform

#### Example:
[Supports(0,2,4,6,8,10)]

# Individual platform implementations

Since some parts of the app has different implementations on some platforms, it can occur that some features or functions behave differently on different platforms.  
We try to implement each feature for each platform that it matches the other platform that no differences occurs

<br/>

#### Why does some platforms have different implementations?
The best understandable reason for different implementations is the **FileSystem**:  
Each OS and/or Platform uses different ways to create, write or delete files
